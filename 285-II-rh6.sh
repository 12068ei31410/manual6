Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection application is loaded 
on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080 the preferred intrusion detection system is 
McAfee HBSS available through Cybercom.

Examine the system to see if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed:

If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, 
this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.
